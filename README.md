# MapCovid Build Instructions

1) Launch the emulator (we have been testing on Pixel_3a_API_30_x86).
2) Change the emulator's location setting by clicking the three dots at the bottom of the white toolbar. Set the location to USC.
3) Launch MapCovid and accept location permissions. Sometimes it takes a second for location to show. If nothing changes back out and re-renter the application or switch back and forth in the navigation bar.
4) You can now view covid location data, testing locations, and center camera on the emulators location.
5) To change permissions after selecting go to the Android settings app and navigate to apps then MapCovid. Change location permission to deny. To view changes, remove app via multi-tasking and click force stop.
6) You are still able to view the map while location permissions are denied, but the app will recommend you accept permission when re-opening.
