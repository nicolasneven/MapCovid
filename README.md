# MapCovid

Ever wonder if it is safe to go to a place? Is the place you’re going to visit too busy to practice
social distancing? Do you know the current COVID infection rate in your neighborhood? In this
unprecedented time, it's important to keep ourselves safe and maintain social distancing. It is
critical for us to know the risks when going out.

MapCovid is a map-based app that can keep you updated on surrounding COVID cases and
infection rates, as well as other important information in your neighborhood.

Major features of MapCovid include:
• The app should at least work in Los Angeles County.
• The main page of the app should show a colored map that represents the severity(cases)
of each city/community, if not possible, you can also use dummy data source made by
yourself.
• The app should be able to display latest local COVID data such as new COVID cases,
deaths, and other important data such as news, COVID-related twitter feed (could be in a
separate tab or page) based on the user's current location or user's input/selection.
• The app should be able to work in the background, and support push notifications.
• Geofencing. Whenever users are moving into a new city/community, notify the user of the
local cases by either push notification or provide an ongoing notification that updates
based on location.
• Travel Tracking. If user permits, the app could provide the ability to track the location/path
that user visited each day, and provide a page that lists travel path, place visited today
and corresponding COVID severity data along the path (such as community level COVID
infection rates). The data should be kept local, and at least for 21 days. Users can revisit
their past travel history anytime in the app.
• Show nearby COVID Test locations and information in the app (such as on the map)
• Ability to delete all privacy related (such as GPS data, history) collected.
• You don’t need to register to use this app.
• Bonus Points: Ability to display if the place is crowded. Similar to the one in Google maps.
